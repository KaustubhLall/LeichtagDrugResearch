'''
This file will have a method to generate all possible n C k features of a given dataset.
The dataset in question has to be pre-processed and some columns may be dropped. For our set, we drop the first 6 
columns, although only after we extract features from column 3 (index 2).

NOTES:
 To get a column by name from a datacontainer d, use d.header.index('name of column header') and pass that result
 into d.getcol().
