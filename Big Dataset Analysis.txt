Notes:
    no class balancing during xval (cross validation)
        Cross validation is 5 fold, with data divided into 5 equal sets. 4 are used to train and one is used to test. 
        Test accuracy is recorded. Process is repeated four additional times, and average test accuracy is used as the score.
    no class balancing during hold one out
        Train on all but one, test on last. Count number of correct / size of dataset.
        
=======================> Big dataset <=======================

Impressions:
    indicators of physical bulk seem important.
    charge is also important. 
    
    Together those two explain a lot of the dataset.
    
    Functional groups (? my chemistry isn't the best) and attachments like COOH/Acetyl help boost accuracy if the first two measures are in place.
    
Best features:
    (not a set, "independently" the best)
    molWeight, Complexity, molArea, nof_HBA, nof_COOH, a_heavy, nof_Rings, nof_COOH, molLogS, molLogP
    
Secondary best (supporting features):
    molLogS, nof_negCharge, nof_acetyl, nof_NH2
    
    
Best feature sets:
    molWeight	molVolume	molLogP	    nof_Chirals	    C_R2
    molWeight	molVolume	molLogP	    nof_HBD	        nof_PO4
    molWeight	molVolume	molLogP	    a_heavy	        nof_SO3H
    molWeight	molVolume	molLogS	    molPSA	        negCharge/Volume
    molWeight	molVolume	molLogP     nof_Chirals 	C_R2
    molWeight	molVolume	molLogP     nof_HBD	        nof_PO4
    molWeight	molVolume	molLogP     a_heavy 	    nof_SO3H
    molWeight	molVolume	molLogS     molPSA	        negCharge/Volume
        ^           ^           ^           ^ ------------ ^   these dont always show up frequently, but work well with these combinations
        |           |           |                                
        |-----------|           both P and S are indistinguishable in effect on accuracy
           having both helps?????
           better scores than removing one
           almost 95% correlation
           
           
           
           
           
 =======================> small dataset <======================
 
 Impressions:
    indicators of physical bulk seem important.
    charge is also important, less extent than big dataset
    
    Together those two explain a lot of the dataset.
    
    Functional groups (? my chemistry isn't the best) and attachments like COOH/Acetyl help boost accuracy if the first two measures are in place.
    
Best features:

Best feature sets:

molWeight	molVolume	nof_HBA	Complexity
molWeight	molLogP	    nof_HBA	Complexity
