Impressions:
    indicators of physical bulk seem important.
    charge is also important. 
    
    Together those two explain a lot of the dataset.
    
    Functional groups (? my chemistry isn't the best) and attachments like COOH/Acetyl help boost accuracy if the first two measures are in place.
    
Best features:
    (not a set, "independently" the best)
    molWeight, Complexity, molArea, nof_HBA, nof_COOH, a_heavy, nof_Rings, nof_COOH, molLogS, molLogP
    
Secondary best (supporting features):
    molLogS, nof_negCharge, nof_acetyl, nof_NH2

        ^           ^           ^           ^ ------------ ^   these dont always show up frequently, but work well with these combinations

        |-----------|           both P and S are indistinguishable in effect on accuracy
           having both helps?????
           better scores than removing one
           almost 95% correlation
